CSS folder
==========

It is good practice to store '.css' files in the 'css' subfolder. [Drupal 8 core themes organize CSS files following the SMACSS style guide](https://www.drupal.org/node/1887922). For a theme to load CSS files they must be defined in '.libraries.yml' file and can be [extended, overridden or removed in '.info.yml' file](https://www.drupal.org/node/2349827).
