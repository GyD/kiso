Layout folder
==========

The 'layout/' folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, main content, sidebars...).

Be aware Kiso (基礎) base theme (including the 'Framework SASS') already provide few layout arrangement rules.

*Take a look at (without modifying):*

* ./kiso/scss/layout/
* ./THEMENAME/_sass-framework/mixins/layout/grid-system/_grid.scss
* ./THEMENAME/_sass-framework/placeholders/layout/grid-system/_grid.scss
