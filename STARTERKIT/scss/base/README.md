Base folder
==========

The 'base/' folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find some additional typographic rules and probably a stylesheet defining some additional styles for commonly used HTML elements.

To avoid 'undoing' styles in components, base styles should reflect the simplest possible appearance of each HTML element.

Be aware Kiso (基礎) base theme (including the Sass Framework) already provide few HTML elements base rules.
