Page Structure Concepts
==========

Well-structured content allows more efficient navigation and processing. Use *HTML5* and *WAI-ARIA* to improve navigation and orientation on web pages and in applications.

* [ARIA Landmarks](aria-landmarks.md)
* [Headings](headings.md)
* [Content Structure](content-structure.md)

## Why is this important?

Pages with well-structured content are essential for many web users, for example:

* **People with cognitive and learning disabilities** can more easily find and prioritize content on the page.
* **People using screen readers** can skip to the main content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them.
* **Keyboard users** can browse pages and their sections more efficiently. Otherwise, users have to press the tab key multiple times to navigate through all links in each section.
* **People using software that only shows the main content** of a web page, such as people with cognitive disabilities, will receive better results if the page structure is correctly marked up.
* **People with visual impairments**, including people with low vision, have cues that provide orientation on the page and in the content.
* **Mobile web users** often have access to a so-called “reader” or “reading” mode that will only show the main content of the page if it is correctly marked up.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
* There are additional benefits to a good, accessible page structure, beyond those experienced by people with disabilities. As an example, search engines can use the data to better index the content of a page.
