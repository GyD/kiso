## About Kiso

**In a nutshell:**

 1. *Kiso* rewrites [Templates](https://github.com/openfed/kiso/tree/master/templates/) from *Drupal* core only if it makes sense to do so, in order to meet specific requirements;
 2. *Kiso* is built with [Accessibility](https://github.com/openfed/kiso/tree/master/docs/accessibility/overview.md) and [CSS coding standards for Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/css/css-coding-standards) in mind;
 3. *Kiso* use a mobile-first [Flexbox grid system](https://github.com/openfed/kiso/tree/master/scss/layout/README.md) to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes;
 4. *Kiso* [Stylesheets (Baseline)](https://github.com/openfed/kiso/tree/master/scss/README.md) is based on the [Drupal 8's CSS (file) organization](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/css/css-file-organization-for-drupal-8), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/ "Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS") & [BEM](http://bem.info/ "Block, Element, Modifier").

## Browser Support

*Kiso* supports the **latest, stable releases** of all major browsers and platforms. On Windows, **Kiso supports Internet Explorer 10-11 / Microsoft Edge**. ([Although Internet Explorer 10 support dropped from Drupal 8.4.x](https://www.drupal.org/node/2897971))

*Kiso* implemented a time saving tool for developers. With this solution you can check if the user’s _Microsoft_ browser can handle your website. If not, it will show a looking notice advising the user to update his browser for latest versions.

Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform’s web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Kiso should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well.
