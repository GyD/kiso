# Define all "Kiso" page layout from here. Use the following example
# to define new layout settings. You can see that the "Kiso Generic Page"
# layout declares a "Main content" and a "Related content" region.
#
# Add a 'complementary' region name and all inner "blocks" will be wrapped
# (by default) using the HTML5 '<aside>' element. This is for blocks which
# need to assign the 'complementary' landmark role to each content designed
# to be complementary to the main content (at a similar level in the DOM
# hierarchy).
